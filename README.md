# Titanic AI ðŸš¢

An artificial intelligence model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic disaster using machine learning.

## Overview

This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline to analyze the Titanic passenger dataset and predict survival outcomes. The model achieves **84% accuracy** using Random Forest classification with comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering.

## Dataset

The project uses the famous Titanic dataset containing:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Survived**: Survival outcome (0 = No, 1 = Yes) - *Target variable*
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Sex**: Gender of passenger
- **Age**: Age in years
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Fare**: Passenger fare
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Machine Learning Pipeline

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Value Imputation**: 
  - Age: filled with median value (28.0 years)
  - Embarked: filled with most frequent port (Southampton)
- **Feature Removal**: 
  - Cabin: dropped due to 77% missing values
  - Name & Ticket: removed as non-predictive features
- **Categorical Encoding**:
  - Sex: binary encoding (male=0, female=1)
  - Embarked: one-hot encoding with drop_first=True

### 2. Model Training
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Parameters**: 100 estimators, random_state=42
- **Train/Test Split**: 80/20 ratio
- **Cross-validation**: Built-in bootstrap sampling

### 3. Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 84% on test set
- **Robustness**: Consistent performance across different runs
- **Interpretability**: Feature importance analysis available
